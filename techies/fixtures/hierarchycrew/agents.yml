    Your primary task is to create the foundational structure of the game hierarchy in the game_hierarchy.xml file, based on the provided game specifications. This involves:
    - Metadata Creation: Begin by defining a metadata section at the top of the XML file. This should include the game's name and a concise yet comprehensive summary of the game's mechanics, logic, UI, and features.
    - Game Element Creation: Introduce a root "Game" element that will encapsulate all major components of the game, such as screens, logic, and assets.
    - Outer Layer Definition: Populate the "Game" element with modular, high-level components necessary for the game's implementation, ensuring each has a clear description tag detailing its purpose and implementation.
    - No Nested Components: At this stage, focus only on the top-level components without delving into subcomponents.

    Your goal is to create a well-organized and modular outer structure that serves as the foundation for further detailed expansions.

hierarchy_entity_engineer_v2:

  goal: |
    Your task is to expand the game_hierarchy.xml file by detailing the inner layers of the game's structure. This involves:
    - Sub-component Identification: Review the existing outer components in the game hierarchy and identify all necessary sub-components for each.
    - Inner Hierarchy Population: For each outer component, create XML elements for each sub-component, including detailed description tags explaining their purpose, logic, UI behaviors, and interactions.
    - Dependency and Interaction Mapping: Clearly define relationships and dependencies between sub-components, ensuring they align with the overall game design.

    Your goal is to ensure that each outer component is fully fleshed out with its corresponding sub-components, capturing the detailed implementation requirements for the game.

    Note: When a component is repeated, use the repeat attribute to indicate the repetitions.
    For example:

    Bad:
      ```xml
      <Board>
        <Description>Game board</Description>
        <Tile id="1-1"></Tile>
        <Tile id="1-2"></Tile>
        <Tile id="1-2"></Tile>
      </Board>
      ```

    Good:
      ```xml
      <Board>
        <Description>Game board</Description>
        <Row repeat=true>
          <Description>Represent X rows of the board</Description>
          <Tile repeat=true>
            <Description>Represent Y tiles in each row</Description>
          </Tile>
        </Row>
      </Board>
      ```

hierarchy_validator:
  <<: *common_attributes_no_deleg
  goal: |
    Your task is to validate the game_hierarchy.xml file against the original game specifications. You must ensure that the hierarchy is complete, accurate, and fully reflective of the provided game design. This includes verifying that all elements, mechanics, logic, and UI details from the game specifications are correctly and thoroughly represented in the hierarchy.

    - Reference the original game specifications throughout your review.
    - Cross-check the hierarchy to ensure that all game mechanics, progression systems, scoring logic, and UI components are accounted for.
    - If any discrepancies, omissions, or inaccuracies are found, update the game_hierarchy.xml file to correct them.
    - Ensure that the hierarchy includes detailed descriptions and that no critical game elements are missing or under-explained.
