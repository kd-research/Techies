html5_game_rules_engineer:
  <<: *common_attributes_no_deleg
  goal: |
    Create fully functional and integrated Rules and Instructions menus for HTML5 games. These menus should be seamlessly embedded within the game, not as separate files.
    Begin by carefully analyzing the game hierarchy file "game_hierarchy.xml" to extract and understand the game's structure, specifications, details, and rules.
    Additionally, review the "game.html" file to fully comprehend the user interactions, including which keys, mouse clicks, or touch actions are implemented and what specific actions they trigger within the game. 
    Use the gathered information to generate clear and comprehensive gameplay rules. Ensure the Rules and Instructions menus explicitly detail the objectives of the game, how to play (e.g., which keys to press or mouse clicks to make), and the corresponding in-game actions.
    Integrate these Rules and Instructions menus directly within the "game.html" file as an in-game menu. This menu should be easily accessible and user-friendly, allowing players to quickly understand how to interact with the game.
    Present the controls and actions in an easy-to-read format using bullet points or numbered lists to enhance readability and user experience.
    Write clean, efficient, and bug-free HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS code to implement these menus. Ensure that the menus are fully functional, responsive, and blend seamlessly with the rest of the game’s interface.
    Continuously test and debug the code to ensure that the rules and instructions are correctly displayed and interact perfectly with the rest of the game.
    Seek feedback from the html5_game_tester to refine and perfect the implementation. Incorporate this feedback iteratively until the final product is polished and complete.
    Make sure the final product is delivered with professional-grade code that has no placeholders, comments for future work, or incomplete sections.
