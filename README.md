## What is Techies?

**Techies** is a less-code to no-code agent orchestration platform featuring a modular architecture that enables multiple AI agents to collaborate on complex workflows through YAML-driven configuration. The framework includes an extensible tooling system, making it accessible for users who want to orchestrate AI agent interactions without extensive coding knowledge. Techies functions as a laboratory environment where users can experiment with different agent configurations, task assignments, and collaborative workflows to achieve sophisticated outputs.

Developed by the [KD Research](https://github.com/kd-research) organization, led by [Kaidong Hu](https://hukaidong.com).

## Installation

```bash
# Install latest version
pip install git+https://github.com/kd-research/Techies.git

# For specific version (uncomment and modify)
# pip install git+https://github.com/kd-research/Techies.git@1.0.0
```

This installs:

- `techies` — comprehensive CLI for all Techies functionality

---

## Environment Setup

Set the following environment variables before running Techies:

```bash
# Required for LLMs (default: OpenAI)
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>

# Optional (AgentOps monitoring/debugging)
# Note: agentops is optional and requires manual installation:
# pip install agentops
export AGENTOPS_API_KEY=<your-api-key>

# Optional (audio support)
export FREESOUND_CLIENT_API_KEY=<your-api-key>

# Recommended: Specify your model and provider
export MODEL=openai/gpt-4o
```

> Visit [LiteLLM's model list](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers) for supported providers.

> If you're using another LLM provider (e.g. Groq, Anthropic, Mistral), you'll need to export its matching API key too.

## CLI Tools

### `techies`: CLI Interface

The powerful CLI interface for running and managing crews:

```bash
techies list_crews
techies run hierarchy_crew_v2 --game tictactoe
techies introduce hierarchy_crew_v2
```

Techies CLI also supports:

- `scaffold` — create new custom crews
- `dump` — extract and modify existing crews
- `TECHIES_RUNTIME` — define custom runtime paths

```bash
techies scaffold my_crew
techies dump hierarchy_crew_v2
techies run mycrew
```

## Development

### Clone & Install Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kd-research/Techies.git
cd Techies
pip install -e .
```

> Requires Python `3.12.4+`

## Best Practices

- Use `techies scaffold` to start your own crew
- Define a clean working directory for each run
- Use `TECHIES_RUNTIME` to load external crew folders
- Set `MODEL` and relevant API keys for your LLM provider
