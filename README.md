## 🚀 What is Techies?

**Techies** is a flexible agent framework for designing and running collaborative, multi-agent workflows. It supports dynamic planning, modular task execution, and structured agent coordination — ideal for creative tasks such as game design, code generation, and more.

Developed by the [KD Research](https://github.com/kd-research) organization, led by [Kaidong Hu](https://hukaidong.com).

## 📦 Installation

Install Techies from GitHub:

```bash
VERSION=1.0.0
pip install git+https://github.com/kd-research/Techies.git@${VERSION}
```

This installs both:

- ✅ `techies` — original stable CLI
- 🧪 `techiex` — new **experimental CLI** (Click-based)

> To alias `techiex` as your default CLI:
> ```bash
> alias techies="techiex"
> ```

---

## 🧰 Environment Setup

Set the following environment variables before running Techies:

```bash
# Required for LLMs (default: OpenAI)
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>

# Optional (AgentOps monitoring/debugging)
export AGENTOPS_API_KEY=<your-api-key>

# Optional (audio support)
export FREESOUND_CLIENT_API_KEY=<your-api-key>

# Recommended: Specify your model and provider
export MODEL=openai/gpt-4o
```

> 🔍 Visit [LiteLLM's model list](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers) for supported providers.

> If you're using another LLM provider (e.g. Groq, Anthropic, Mistral), you'll need to export its matching API key too.

## ⚙️ CLI Tools

### ✅ `techies`: Original CLI

Stable, tested interface for running built-in crews.

```bash
techies list_crews
techies run hierarchy_crew_v2 --game tictactoe
techies introduce hierarchy_crew_v2
```

### 🧪 `techiex`: Experimental CLI (Drop-in Replacement)

Fully modular CLI with support for:

- 🛠️ `scaffold` — create new custom crews
- 🧠 `dump` — extract and modify existing crews
- 🌍 `TECHIES_RUNTIME` — define custom runtime paths

```bash
techiex scaffold my_crew
techiex dump hierarchy_crew_v2
techiex run mycrew
```

> `techiex` supports everything `techies` does — and more.
