# Setting environment variables

First, we need to make sure that all the required API keys are added to your environment variable. These include:
- [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/index/openai-api/) Key: For using openAI LLM models \
  `export OPENAI_API_KEY=<Your API Key>`
- [Agentops AI](https://www.agentops.ai/) Key: For agents' monitoring, testing and debugging \
  `export AGENTOPS_API_KEY=<Your API Key>`
- [Freesound API](https://freesound.org/apiv2/apply) Key: For downloading sound resources \
  `export FREESOUND_CLIENT_API_KEY=<Your API Key>`

# Usage

    ```

- Show avaliable crews
    ```bash
    $ techies list_crews
    ```
- Show help on specific crew
    ```bash

    ```


# Developing Techies

## To compile

Follow these steps to compile the project locally:
```bash
# Clone the latest code from the remote branch
$ git clone https://github.com/kd-research/Techies.git
# Move to the root director
$ cd Techies
# Compile the code
$ pip install -e .
```

As long as no error appears, it means all the dependencies have been met, and the code is good to go!
  
## To run

Follow these steps to run *Hierarch Crew* (game tree)  and/or *HTML Crew* (coding):
```bash
# Create a new working directory in the root and move there
$ mkdir working_dir
$ cd working_dir
```

### For Hierarchy Crew

- Use the following command to run the hierarchy crew
    ```bash
    $python ../techies/cli.py --ai `LLM_MODEL` run hierarchy_crew_v2 --game `GAME_SPECS` 
    ```
    Here is a sample run:
    ```bash
    $ python ../techies/cli.py --ai openai run hierarchy_crew_v2 --game Wordlenew_game_specifications
    ```
  
- You can choose an exisiting [game specification](https://github.com/kd-research/Techies/blob/main/techies/game_specs.py) or add a new one in the same file.
- The hierarchy crew will generate a game_hierarchy.xml (game tree file), in the current working directory (e.g., inside working_dir/)

### For HTML Crew

- Use the following command to run the HTML crew
    ```bash
    $ python ../techies/cli.py --ai `LLM_MODEL` run html5_crew
    ```

    Here is a sample run:
    ```bash
    $ python ../techies/cli.py --ai openai run html5_crew
    ```
  
- HTML crew assumes that there is a `game_hierarchy.xml` file exist in the current working directory (e.g., working_dir/game_hierarchy.xml).
- The HTML crew will generate a couple of files as output in the current working directory (E.g., inside working_dir/). These include:
    - index.html
    - style.css
    - script.js
    - game.html (combines `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`)
    - *.mp3 (sounds files)
- You can run the game by either running `game.html` or `index.html`
